# about-me

Not much I feel comfortable giving out, other than the fact that I am a 16 year old shut in currently studing a Cert IV in Information Technology.

Currently learning webdev on the side for fun, [My website](https://cynaax.neocities.org) as an example, I also have some local shit laying around.
